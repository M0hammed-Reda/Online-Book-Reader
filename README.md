# Online Book Reader

## Overview
This C++ console project, **Online Book Reader**, allows both admins and users to interact with a digital library system. The admin can add new books and view their profile, while the user can sign up, log in, view their profile, browse and read books, and see their reading history. I created this project to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and improve my design and programming skills.

## Features

### Admin:
- Add new books to the system
- View admin profile

### User:
- Sign up or log in
- View user profile
- Browse and read books
- View reading history

## Purpose
This project was developed to enhance my understanding of OOP principles and improve my design and programming skills.
